# Logic Gates
The study of logic goes back (at least!) to our earliest cultural origins; the Arabs, Greeks, Chinese and Indians all had advanced concepts which were the origin of our modern science.  In modern computer science and mathematics, we trace our reasoning back to Aristotle and the early Greek mathematicians, as we strove to formally describe reasoning, arguments and proofs in an unambiguous mathematical language. The term logic itself comes from the Greek λογική logikē or the study or arguments. 

Some of the most important work in logic (in fact the basis of modern computer theory) was carried out by George Boole at UCC from 1849. Boole established the system now known as Boolean algebra, where variables are truth values true or false. The device which we based our electronic revolution on was the transistor; electronic switches which could have the values on or off. Boolean algebra was ideally suited to this binary environment has been fundamental to our development of digital logic, modern electronics, and eventually computing. In the 1930’s, Claude Shannon applied Boolean algebra to circuits built using switches, providing the foundations for modern computing.

Boolean expressions are normally true or false, or on and off, or 1 and 0, all are representations of the same thing. In any system, we can have Boolean variables which can contain a Boolean expression. 

Boolean operators let us look at the relationship between the state of these variables and an output. Let’s go with variable C for an output.  We know that if A is on (true) and B is on (true) then the machine is safe and C should be equal to on (true) But look at all the possible cases that give rise to an output. We call this a truth table; it allows us to look at all possible inputs and have a predictable and desired output.
